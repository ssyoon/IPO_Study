CONSENT TO TAKE PART IN A RESEARCH STUDY

TITLE OF STUDY: Initial Public Offering Simulation
Principal Investigator: Nathan Fong

This consent form is part of an informed consent process for a research study and it will provide information that will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study.  It is your choice to take part or not. After all of your questions have been answered and you wish to take part in the research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a copy of the signed form to keep. Your alternative to taking part in the research is not to take part in it.

Who is conducting this research study and what is it about?
You are being asked to take part in research being conducted by Nathan Fong who is a professor in the School of Business – Camden. The purpose of this study is to examine bidding behavior in auctions for initial public offerings (IPOs).

What will I be asked to do if I take part?
The experiment will take about one hour to complete, which consists of the IPO simulation followed by a survey. We anticipate 132 subjects will take part in the study.

What are the risks and/or discomforts I might experience if I take part in the study?
The reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts are minimal. Breach of confidentiality is a risk of harm, but your identity will not be linked to your responses, and a data security plan is in place to minimize such a risk. Also, some survey questions may make you feel uncomfortable. If that happens, you can skip those questions or withdraw from the study altogether. If you decide to quit at any time before you have finished the survey, your answers will NOT be recorded.

Are there any benefits to me if I choose to take part in this study?
There no direct benefits to you for taking part in this research. You will be contributing to knowledge about bidding behavior.

Will I be paid to take part in this study?
You will be paid based on the outcome of the IPO simulation. The payment will be in cash upon completion of the experiment.

How will information about me be kept private or confidential?
All efforts will be made to keep your responses confidential, but total confidentiality cannot be guaranteed.
•	We will ask you to provide your name and contact information when you receive payment, in order to record your participation in the study. This identifiable information will not be linked to or stored with your responses.

No information that can identify you will appear in any professional presentation or publication.

What will happen to information I provide in the research after the study is over?
•	Responses may be used or distributed to investigators for other research without obtaining additional informed consent from you.
•	Authorized representatives from the Department of the Navy Human Research Protection Program may review and/or obtain identifiable information related to your participation in this research study as part of their responsibility to protect human research subject volunteers.

What will happen if I do not want to take part or decide later not to stay in the study?
Your participation is voluntary. If you choose to take part now, you may change your mind and withdraw later. In addition, you may skip questions that you are not comfortable answering. You may leave without turning in a completed form or by turning in a blank or incomplete form. However, once you turn in the form, you can no longer withdraw your responses as we will not know which ones yours are.

Who can I call if I have questions?
If you have questions about taking part in this study, you can contact the Principal Investigator: Nathan Fong, School of Business – Camden, nathan.fong@rutgers.edu.

If you have questions about your rights as a research subject, you can contact the IRB Director at: Arts and Sciences IRB, (732) 235-2866, or the Rutgers Human Subjects Protection Program at (973) 972-1149 or email us at humansubjects@ored.rutgers.edu.
